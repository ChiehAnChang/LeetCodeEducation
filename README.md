# LeetCode Learning Repository 👨‍💻

## Motivation 🎯

I am not the kind of person who enjoys simply "knowing the algorithm(i.e., ❌ Here is the algorithm. Use it! )" or just "memorizing the code." Instead, I prefer to deeply understand the underlying concepts behind each LeetCode problem.

This repository is built with the goal of creating structured templates that guide me—and hopefully others—to truly comprehend the core ideas behind solving these problems, rather than relying on rote memorization.

## Goal 🥅

- Develop and share structured templates for problem-solving.

- Achieve a deeper understanding of LeetCode problems through conceptual clarity.

- Foster a genuine grasp of algorithmic thinking and coding logic.
